# Project: Traffic Classification
# Issues to go through: https://github.com/noise-lab/service-recognition/issues
# Questions:
* For research direction, (1) GAN based classifier or (2) select robust features by comparing datasets and build efficient classifier.
* When we talk about efficient classifier, what are we considering? System costs, quantization of features? How do we emulate only capturing certain features?
* What does aggregated bit-level feature importance imply? Is it a good representation of field level importance? If not, do we create our own semantic encoder?
