# Project: Traffic Classification

Sigcomm Submission Discussion:

1. Abstract revision, potential shrinking down.

2. Evaluation Takeaways.

3. Additional results, what's left to add.

4. Additional comparision to similar attempts.



Evaluation Improvements:

1.    Trade-off cluster chart in memory constrained setting. Challenge: memory constraint for baseline is too high, which is practically giving our module unlimited resources to select identical classifier and batch, i.e., identical performance and TTD.

2. Behavior profiling, add classifier selection under varying memory constraints and traffic rates.
