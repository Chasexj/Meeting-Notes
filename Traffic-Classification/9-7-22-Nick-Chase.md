# Project: Traffic Classification and Automated Censorship Detection

Discussion:

1. We fixed the labeling bug and it rerunning the models and hyperparameter tuning. Will have all the results by the end of next week and start the paper writing process by the 15th. However, we need to determine a research track for submission to the Web conference:
   
   1. https://www2023.thewebconf.org/calls/research-tracks/

2. IAB position paper is accepted which is to be held on October 17th.

3. Discussion on recent result on traffic classification:
   
   1. It is hard to have a universal model.
   
   2. Through adapting data drfit measurements into the feature selection mechanism, we can reduce the step of repeared feature engineering when given new datasets while maintaining reasonable performance.
   
   3. See slides 23-32 for detailed illustrations of the findings.

3. Discussion on HonNets paper reviews which is organized in https://github.com/noise-lab/service-recognition/issues/27.
