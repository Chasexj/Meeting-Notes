### HotNets (traffic classification under encryption)
Revised Introduction and Discussion Sections: Added concrete steps and preliminary results for many research agenda items.
Group-meeting: Read through Introduction and Discussion to see if there are any critical changes to be made.

### HotNets (NetDiffusion)
Preliminary classifcation results obtained for future research direction with stable diffusion and control net - over 100% accuracy improvement
on downsteam micro level application classification tasks and ~70% accuracy on macro-level service classification.
Future research direction: the generation process is currently a rough protocol,we need to implement specific post generation details and potentiallt tabular diffusion models for better generation results for further improvement.
TODO - paper writing.
