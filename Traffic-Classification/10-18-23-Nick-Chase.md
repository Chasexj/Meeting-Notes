# NetDiffusion Continuation
Time series construction

TCP flag correction

Context Transfer

Scale to additional tasks.

# LLM for Routing Configuration

Brainstorm and preliminary results: can we use LLM for general anomaly detection in routing configurations?

# Foundation ML model for Network tasks

IPFIX/NetFlow classification tasks.

Foundation model training target: (1) domain knowledge based, (2) generalization based, (3) random subset based

Curation of additional datasets encompassing different tasks: criteria - we need different datasets with common attributes

There is no time-series dependency if we do flow-level foundation model, i.e., we do not necessarily need to rely only on transformer models.
