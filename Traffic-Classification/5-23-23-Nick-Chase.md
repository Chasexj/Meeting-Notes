### NetDiffusion
To-Do: Add additional baselines beyond NetShare
Decide what results for stable diffusion generation:
Finished results: Implemented concept of conversion between encoded raw traffic and image representations that suits network specific problems; trained generator that can produced encoded raw traffic for binary classification with intra-packet correlation captured using control-net; successful generation of synthetic encoded network traffic for binary classification.
To-Do: Full scale (10-class) classification.
